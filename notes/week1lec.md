## Course Description  
This course provides a theoretical account of consumption as a **cultural activity**. Consumers interact with each other, the market, and socio-cultural institutions through consumption. Consumption is both an individual activity for satisfying needs and an aggregate cultural phenomenon. This course reviews consumer culture and consumer behaviour theories to understand their implications for marketers.  

### Course Learning Outcomes  
1. Identify relevant consumer culture and behaviour theories  
2. Examine theories in individual, marketplace, and cultural contexts  
3. Relate consumption experiences to consumer culture and behaviour theories  
4. Critique theories in different contexts  
5. Demonstrate the use of evidence and theory in marketing strategies  
6. Reflect on personal consumption experiences

## Theoretical Perspectives on Consumption  
### Why Do We Consume? **Value!**  
- **Exchange value**: Market transactions  
- **Value-in-use**: Consumption experience  
- **Symbolic value**: Identity expression  
- **Value co-creation**: Collaboration between producers and consumers  

### **Theoretical Perspectives**  
- **Economic perspective**: Value destruction by consumers  
- **Symbolic perspective**: Product meanings transfer value  
- **Consumer culture perspective**: Consumption is culturally embedded  

---  
## Consumer Research Perspectives  
### Philosophical Perspectives  
- **Positivism (Modernism)**  
- **Interpretivism (Postmodernism)**  

### Consumer Research: Positivism vs. Interpretivism  
- **Positivism**: Structured, objective study of consumer behavior  
- **Interpretivism**: Subjective, meaning-driven consumer insights  

---  
## Consumption Types  
### How We Consume  
- **Consuming as an experience**: Emotional or aesthetic reactions  
- **Consuming as integration**: Expressing identity through consumption  
- **Consuming as classification**: Associating with objects socially  
- **Consuming as play**: Participating in shared consumer experiences  

**Example:** Gaming Consumption  
- **Experience**: Playing the game and enjoying it  
- **Integration**: Customizing an avatar, choosing storylines  
- **Classification**: Using game-related images on social media  
- **Play**: Interacting in online communities

## Marketing Ethics  
### Influence vs. Manipulation  
- **Do marketers create artificial needs?**  
  - *Need*: A biological necessity  
  - *Want*: A learned way to satisfy that need  
- **Are advertising and marketing necessary?**  
  - Marketing provides consumer information  
- **Do marketers promise miracles?**  
  - Advertisers lack total control over consumer behavior  

### Consumer Responsibility  
- **Buyer Beware vs. Seller Regulation**  
- **Consumer Responsibilisation**: A neoliberal governance approach that shifts responsibility for social problems from institutions to individuals.  
  - *Example:* Carbon footprint calculators place responsibility on consumers rather than corporations.  

### State Solutions to Social Problems  
- **Example:** Carbon markets as a regulatory approach  
- Government policies and incentives to mitigate environmental issues  

### Discussion Questions  
- Is it consumers’ responsibility to buy no or little plastic?  
- Is it consumers’ responsibility to recycle plastic?  
- What are the alternatives to the plastic problem?
